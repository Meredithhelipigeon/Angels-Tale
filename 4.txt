In a part of the woods was a big fig tree with huge branches. A flock of geese lived there, and happy they were, you can be sure of that. But at the roots of the tree, a little vine was starting to grow. A wise old goose said. Do you see that little vine. The one starting to climb up our tree. It could be trouble some day. I saw this happen once when I was a little bird. If we do not pull the vine away now when it is still small and easy to cut, over time it will grow bigger and thicker. Then some day. the vine will be big and thick enough for someone to climb. A hunter will be able to climb up the vine and kill us. And that is why. Said the wise old goose. We must get rid of the vine while we can.
