A soft and fluffy Velveteen Rabbit lived in a toybox in a Boy's room. Each day, the Boy opened the toybox and picked up Velveteen Rabbit. And Velveteen Rabbit was happy. Then newer, brighter toys came into the toybox. They had special tricks. Some could move when the Boy pushed a button. Others bounced high.  Velveteen Rabbit had no special tricks or buttons. No wonder the Boy started to choose these other new toys. At night, when the toys were back all in the toy box, the other toys talked with pride about the fine things they could do. Velveteen Rabbit was quiet.  There was not much to say.
