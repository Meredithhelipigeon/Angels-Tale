" A soft Rabbit lived in a toybox in a Boys room. Each day the Boy opened the toy box and picked up Rabbit. Rabbit was happy. They had special tricks. Some could move when the Boy pushed a button. Others bounced high. Rabbit had no special tricks or buttons. At night when the toys were back all in the toy box. The other toys talked with pride about the fine things they could do. "
